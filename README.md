### Hello! I'm Gabriella, and welcome to my github!

I'm that junior software developer and devops/sysadmin who spends a lot of time caring about how her online profiles look!

At the moment I'm currently taking a kind of gap year from University, but prior to that, I was studying Computer Science at Michigan Technological University and working with MTU IT as one of a three-person team in Operations dedicated to working with MacOS!

<!-- I'm currently interning at Sentry Insurance as a Information Technology Intern-->

Below is some of the stuff I've worked on and I'm interested in!
- ADS-B IN command-line interface (think `top` but for reading ADS-B info coming off of airplanes)
- Flight Sim modding (I lurk on the Working Title CJ4)
- Helping friends with tools for their games! (Destiny 2 & FFXIV are two focuses right now)
- Creating command-line tools for productivity and leaving notes for yourself without having `git` track them!

Feel free to interact with me on Twitter!
