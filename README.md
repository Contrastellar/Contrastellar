### Hello! I'm Gabriella `(she/hers)`, and welcome to my github!

I'm that junior software developer and devops engineer who spends a lot of time caring about how her online profiles look!

Currently studying Computer Science and Meteorology, with minors in Math and Creative Writing at MSU Denver.

Below is some of the stuff I've worked on and I'm interested in!
- The OpossumBot Discord Bot which is a 'for-fun' project of mine for posting Opossum pictures to Discord 
- Flight Sim modding (I lurk on the Working Title CJ4)
- Creating tools/web tools for various games that I play (Stellaris, Destiny 2, FFXIV, etc.)

Feel free to interact with me on Twitter!
