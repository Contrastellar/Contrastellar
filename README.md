### Hello! I'm Gabriella `(she/hers)`, and welcome to my github!

I'm that junior software developer and devops engineer who spends a lot of time caring about how her online profiles look!

Currently studying Computer Science and Meteorology, with a minor in Math at MSU Denver.

I'm a Author, Musician, and GameDev

Below is some of the stuff I've worked on and I'm interested in!
- Project Elysium -- Details `tba`.
- MTG_Scryfall_Grabber -- a python module to grab JSON from [scryfall](https://scryfall.com)
- The OpossumBot Discord Bot which is a 'for-fun' project of mine for posting Opossum pictures to Discord 
- Creating tools/web tools for various games that I play (Stellaris, Destiny 2, FFXIV, etc.)
